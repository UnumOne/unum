# Introduction

## What is Unum?
Unum is a decentralized, trustless crypto-currency whose price is linked to the U.S. dollar.  One Unum is worth $1.

## Stable Price

Unum can be exchanged for a variety of other crypto-currencies. If you exchange $50 worth of Ether for Unum, you'll receive 50 Unum.  The Ether you traded for Unum is held in reserve by the Unum Smart Contract. At any time you can trade your Unum back into Ether, or any other crypto-currency held by the Unum Smart Contract.

## Decentralized

Exchanging crypto-currencies for Unum, and vice-versa, occurs directly through the Unum Smart Contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. There is no intermediary organization to handle the exhange, no matching of buyers and sellers, and no approval needed.

Unum can be purchased on this website by users with an Ethereum blockchain plugin such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), or through the use of external tools such as [Parity](https://parity.io/).

## Trustless

When we say Unum is trustless, we mean that the owner of the Unum Smart Contract **cannot**:

* Withdraw tokens or Ethereum from the Unum Reserve
* Create or issue Unum 
* Move Unum between accounts
* Destroy the Unum Smart Contract
* Prevent the purchase or sale of Unum for other crypto-currencies.
* Change the exchange price of Unum from $1
* Change the conversion fee for selling Unum

All of this is enforced by the Unum Smart Contract, which cannot be altered, even by the owner. The Unum Smart Contract is open source and can be viewed on Github.

In addition, there was no pre-sale, pre-mine, or ICO of Unum.  

# Price Oracle

The Price Oracle is a Smart Contract on the Ethereum Blockchain maintained by the owner of Unum.  The Price Oracle is constantly being updated with the current price of crypto-currencies on existing exchanges.  When Unum is exchanged, the Unum Smart Contract looks up the price of the exchanged crypto-currency on the Price Oracle to determine the exchange rate.

# Fees

## Buying 

There is no fee to trade a supported crypto-currency into Unum.  Every dollar value of currency sent in results in one Unum being issued.

For example, if the price of Ethereum is $310, and you traded 1 Ether for Unum, you would receive 310 Unum.

## Selling

There is a .01% conversion fee to trade Unum for any crypto-currency held in the Unum Smart Contract reserve. In other words, for every $100 worth of Unum converted into another crypto-currency held in the Unum Reserve, 1 cent is held in fees.

For example, if you traded 310 Unum for Ether, and the price of Ether is $310, the conversion fee would equal $0.031. Any Unum traded for crypto-currencies held in the reserve is destroyed after the trade is complete.

This conversion fee is used to pay for the Ether needed to maintain the up-to-date prices on the USD Price Oracle contract.  

## Reserve Deficit Sell Penalty

Because the values of crypto-currencies ar highly volatile, it is possible for the value of the crypto-currencies held in reserve by the Unum Smart contract to become worth less than the total supply of Unum issued. In such times a Reserve Deficit Sell Penalty is applied to all exchanges of Unum into crypto-currrencies held in the reserve.  This penalty is meant to discourage Unum traders from increasing the reserve deficit.

**The Reserve Deficit Sell Penalty is equal to 1/10th of the reserve deficit percent.**  If the US Dollar value of the reserve held by the Unum Smart Contract greater than the number of Unum in circulation, then no Reserve Deficit Sell Penalty is applied.

For example, if there are 1,000,000 Unum in circulation, but the US Dollar value of the reserve held by the Unum Smart Contract is worth only $950,000, then the reserve has a deficit of 5%.  This would equate to a .5% Reserve Deficit Sell Penalty, which is in addition to the conversion fee described above.

In this case, if you traded 310 Unum for Ether, and the price of Ether is $310, the conversion fee of .01% would equal 3.1 cents and the Reserve Deficit Sale Penalty would equal $1.55.

# Bonus Sales

The stability of Unum is increased when the value of the crypto-currencies held in reserve by the Unum Smart Contract is increased. To encourage users to purchase Unum, and increase it's stability, occasionally Bonus Sale events are held.

During these events, and users who purchase Unum will receive an additional percentage bonus of Unum.  These bonuses start at 1%, and increase by 1% each day until the Bonus Sale is over (no more than 10 days), or the Unum Cap for the sale is reached.

Any upcoming Bonus Sales will be announced in advance on our Blog.
